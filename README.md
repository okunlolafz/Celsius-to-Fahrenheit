**Readme for Temperature Scale Converter Program**

**Description:**
The Temperature Scale Converter Program, created by Okunlola Faozee Bayo, is written in Fortran. This program converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and outputs the results to an external file named "Output.txt."

**Usage:**
1. Run the program by executing the provided Fortran code.
2. The program will perform temperature conversions for Celsius values ranging from 20 to 30, with a step of 3.
3. The results will be written to the "Output.txt" file.

**Output Format:**
- The program outputs a table in the "Output.txt" file containing Celsius temperatures and their corresponding Fahrenheit equivalents.

**Note:**
- The conversion formula used is F = (9 * C / 5) + 32, where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit, and C is the temperature in Celsius.

**About:**
The Temperature Scale Converter Program demonstrates a simple temperature conversion using a loop to iterate through a range of Celsius temperatures. It provides a practical example of basic mathematical computations in Fortran.
